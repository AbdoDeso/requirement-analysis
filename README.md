# What is Requirement Analysis?

#### Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, documenting, and validating the needs and constraints of stakeholders to define what a software system must do. It ensures that developers fully understand user expectations, reducing misunderstandings and costly changes later in development. This phase is critical in the SDLC as it sets the foundation for design, coding, testing, and successful project delivery.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

### 1. **Prevents Misunderstandings**: Clearly defines stakeholder needs to ensure developers and clients share the same vision.  
### 2. **Saves Time and Cost**: Identifying issues early reduces expensive changes and rework during later stages of development.  
### 3. **Improves Product Quality**: Ensures the final product meets user expectations, enhancing satisfaction and usability.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

### 1. **Requirement Gathering**: Involves collecting needs and expectations from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, or workshops to understand what the system should do.  
### 2. **Requirement Elicitation**: A structured process to uncover hidden or unclear requirements using techniques like brainstorming, prototyping, or observation.  
### 3. **Requirement Documentation**: Captures gathered requirements in a clear, organized format such as use cases, user stories, or SRS documents for future reference.  
### 4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Involves analyzing requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness, often using models like data flow diagrams or UML to represent system behavior.  
### 5. **Requirement Validation**: Ensures that the documented requirements are correct, complete, and aligned with stakeholder needs through reviews, walkthroughs, or prototyping.
